boilerplate for an oSoc18 project using the MEAN stack.\nMuch of the project design comes from mean.io. However, it is using Angular version 6, and the latest version of all MEAN dependencies. The ability to use the ng-cli should make extending this boilerplate significantly easier.\nHow to start\n// Install mongo db\n> npm install\n> npm start\n// Navigate to http://localhost:4200/Or with Docker\n> docker-compose up\n// Navigate to http://localhost:4200/Angular\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.0.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nExpress\n\nExpress server can be started with node src/server-start.js\nOnce the angular project has been built, it will be hosted automatically by express\nThe heroes API can be found at http://localhost:4040/api/heroes\n\nMongo DB\n\nDefault db is named mean\nDefault port is 27017\nConfiguration can be updated in .env\n\nDocker\n\nTo start a dockerized version of your application, use docker-compose up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Octotrails\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
